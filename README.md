# SquareRootFunction
-This C++ program which estimates the square root of a given number by finding the nearest square and using my custom algorithm to improve the approximation. The program works on macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.

###ðŸš€Features
-Digit-based Logic: The program uses the number of digits in the input number to determine how to search for the nearest square.

-Efficient Search: A binary search is employed to find the closest square, improving performance.

-Approximate Square Root Calculation: After finding the nearest square, the program estimates the square root using a custom formula.

###ðŸ“‹ Requirements
-To compile and run the program, you'll need:
-A C++ compiler (G++, Clang, or MSVC).

-I hope that you have alredy instealld the compiler on(linux, windows and mac)

###ðŸ”¥How to run this program --->

```bash

Clone the repository (or copy the code to a .cpp file)

git clone https://github.com/Dracula699/SquareRootFunction.git
cd SquareRootFunction

Compile the program:
In your terminal, run the following command:

g++ -o Output SquareRoot.cpp -std=c++11

Run the program
./Output.exe (for windows and linux) (idk about mac)
